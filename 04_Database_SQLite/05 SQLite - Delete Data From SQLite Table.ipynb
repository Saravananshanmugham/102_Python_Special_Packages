    "### Steps to Delete data From SQLite Table\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Connect to SQLite from Python\n",
    "Use the connect() method of the connector class with the database name. To establish a connection to SQLite, you need to pass the database name you want to connect. If you specify the database file name that already presents on the disk, it will connect to it. But if your specified SQLite database file doesn’t exist, SQLite creates a new database for you. This method returns the SQLite Connection Object if the connection is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Define a SQL Delete Query\n",
    "Next, prepare a SQL delete query to delete a row from a table. Delete query contains the row to be deleted based on a condition placed in where clause of a query. For example, `DELETE FROM MySQL_table WHERE id=10;`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Get Cursor Object from Connection\n",
    "Next, use a `connection.cursor()` method to create a cursor object. using cursor object we can execute SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Execute the delete query using execute() method\n",
    "The `cursor.execute(query)` method executes the operation stored in the delete query.\n",
    "After a successful delete operation, the `execute()` method returns the number of rows affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Commit your changes\n",
    "After successfully executing a delete operation, make changes persistent into a database using the `commit()` of a connection class.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6: Get the number of rows affected\n",
    "Use a `cursor.rowcount` method to get the number of rows affected. The count depends on how many rows you are deleting. You can also execute SQLite select query from Python to verify the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 7: Close the cursor object and database connection object\n",
    "use `cursor.clsoe()` and `connection.clsoe()` method to close the cursor and SQLite connections after your work completes."
