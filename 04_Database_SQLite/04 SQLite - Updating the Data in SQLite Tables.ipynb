    "### Steps to Update Data in SQLite Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1: Connect to SQLite from Python\n",
    "Use the connect() method of the connector class with the database name. To establish a connection to SQLite, you need to pass the database name you want to connect. If you specify the database file name that already presents on the disk, it will connect to it. But if your specified SQLite database file doesn’t exist, SQLite creates a new database for you. This method returns the SQLite Connection Object if the connection is successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 2: Prepare a SQL Update Query\n",
    "Prepare an update statement query with data to update. Mention the column name we want to update and its new value. For example, `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2...., columnN = valueN WHERE [condition];`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 3: Execute the UPDATE query, using cursor.execute()\n",
    "This method executes the operation stored in the UPDATE query.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 4: Commit your changes\n",
    "After the successful execution of the SQLite update query, Don’t forget to commit your changes to the database using `connection.comit()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 5: Extract the number of rows affected\n",
    "After a successful update operation, use a `cursor.rowcount` method to get the number of rows affected. The count depends on how many rows you are updating.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 6: Verify result using the SQL SELECT query\n",
    "Execute a SQLite select query from Python to see the new changes\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 7: Close the cursor object and database connection object\n",
    "use `cursor.clsoe()` and `connection.clsoe()` method to close SQLite connections once the update operation completes."
