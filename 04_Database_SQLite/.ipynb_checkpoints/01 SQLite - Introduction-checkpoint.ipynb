SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.\n",

    "SQLite is an embedded SQL database engine. Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files. A complete SQL database with multiple tables, indices, triggers, and views, is contained in a single disk file. The database file format is cross-platform - you can freely copy a database between 32-bit and 64-bit systems or between big-endian and little-endian architectures\n",

If you specify the database file name that already presents on the disk, it will connect to it. But if your specified SQLite database file doesn’t exist, SQLite creates a new database for you.\n",
    "This method returns the SQLite `Connection Object` if the connection is successful.\n",

    "##### Use the cursor() method\n",

    "The `execute()` methods run the SQL query and return the result.\n",

    "##### Extract result using fetchall()\n",
    "Use cursor `.fetchall()` or `fetchone()` or `fetchmany()` to read query result.\n",
